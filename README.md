## JDBC Connection with 'jaydebeapi'

This project demonstrates how to use the jaydebeapi Python package to connect to databases using Java Database Connectivity (JDBC). The jaydebeapi package allows Python applications to interact with databases through JDBC drivers, offering a seamless integration between Python and enterprise database systems.

Requirements:
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on your system.
- JDBC driver JAR file for the database you wish to connect to.
## JDBC Connection with Apache Spark
This project demonstrates how to use Apache Spark to connect to databases using Java Database Connectivity (JDBC). Apache Spark is a powerful distributed computing system that allows you to process large amounts of data efficiently. By leveraging JDBC, Spark can interact with various database systems, providing a scalable solution for data processing and analytics.

Requirements:
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on your system.
- Apache Spark installed and configured.
- JDBC driver JAR file for the database you wish to connect to.
